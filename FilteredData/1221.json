And so, when a serviceman dies, it\u2019s a tear in the fabric, a break in the whole, and all we can do is remember.\"~President Ronald Reagan  \n#MemorialDay #NeverForgotten\nhttps://youtu.be/arSiv9PRo04", "cleaned_message": ["sometim", "back", "receiv", "name", "countri", "bodi", "four", "marin", "die", "activ", "duti", "said", "special", "sad", "accompani", "death", "serviceman", "never", "quit", "good", "enough", "realli", "gave", "us", "beyond", "power", "repay", "serviceman", "die", "tear", "fabric", "break", "whole", "rememb", "presid", "ronald", "reagan"], "emojis": null, "mentions": null, "names": ["Ronald Reagan"], "message_tags": ["MemorialDay", "neverforgotten"], "attachments": [{"media_type": "share", "media_url": "https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2FarSiv9PRo04&h=AT0ursMdrTo9WNvlOKo6vIxdZ7PfJpHNEJZyxWYhzbTuyeSmdIYLDXtu54VstSgJ8nlnhN9-rHx_qHl4b6KDgVQ4Yf6pRIfEtLc-noCiP7M3LrT9MSsCdtLshji_3FjH&s=1", "media_description": "Memorial Day Tribute - \"Thank You\"", "thumbnail_url": "https://external-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQGYK38Vu5R0cBr7&w=720&h=720&url=https%3A%2F%2Fi.ytimg.com%2Fvi%2FarSiv9PRo04%2Fmaxresdefault.jpg&cfs=1&sx=804&sy=0&sw=1080&sh=1080&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQEOwAJYFkoPcD5n"}], "urls": ["https://youtu.be/arSiv9PRo04"]}
