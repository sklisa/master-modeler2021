Your support helped meet the basic needs of some of the individuals we are serving. After a person is recovered or escapes a trafficking situation, their new journey is just beginning. It can take several years to heal and rebuild. Many teens that are trafficked do not have healthy homes to return to, leaving them on their own. When they turn 18, they have few resources available to them. With your help, we continue to assist long after they turn 18. #birthdayfundraisers #EndHumanTrafficking", "cleaned_message": ["help", "support", "help", "meet", "basic", "need", "individu", "serv", "person", "recov", "escap", "traffick", "situat", "new", "journey", "begin", "take", "sever", "year", "heal", "rebuild", "mani", "teen", "traffick", "healthi", "home", "return", "leav", "turn", "resourc", "avail", "help", "continu", "assist", "long", "turn"], "emojis": null, "mentions": null, "names": null, "message_tags": ["birthdayfundraisers", "endhumantrafficking"], "attachments": [{"media_type": "photo", "media_url": "https://www.facebook.com/helperase/photos/a.1029649477086727/3788572424527738/?type=3", "media_description": "Timeline Photos", "thumbnail_url": null}], "urls": null}
