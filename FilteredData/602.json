From medical providers to law enforcement to advocacy, it is not for everyone. The most important thing we can do when working with individuals that have been victimized by human trafficking is to Do No Harm. Being survivor and trauma informed is essential for any organization working in the human trafficking space. \nOur prime purpose in this life is to help others. And if you can't help them, at least don't hurt them. ~Dalai Lama\n#BeKind #BeInformed #BetheDifference", "cleaned_message": ["work", "anti-human", "traffick", "field", "challeng", "time", "medic", "provid", "law", "enforc", "advocaci", "everyon", "import", "thing", "work", "individu", "victim", "human", "traffick", "harm", "survivor", "trauma", "inform", "essenti", "organ", "work", "human", "traffick", "space", "prime", "purpos", "life", "help", "help", "least", "hurt", "dalai", "lama"], "emojis": null, "mentions": null, "names": null, "message_tags": ["bekind", "BeInformed", "BeTheDifference"], "attachments": [{"media_type": "photo", "media_url": "https://www.facebook.com/helperase/photos/a.1029649477086727/2477277155657278/?type=3", "media_description": "Timeline Photos", "thumbnail_url": null}], "urls": null}
