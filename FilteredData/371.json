More than 90 federal, state and local law enforcement agencies and task forces from across California participated.\nThe three-day, statewide effort aimed at combatting human trafficking, took place between Thursday, January 24, and Saturday, January 26, 2019, and was conducted in various mediums and met with positive results. Over the three day period, the San Bernardino County Task Force conducted enforcement operations consisting of 2-3 operational phases per day. Operations were conducted throughout the county and specifically within the cities of San Bernardino, Ontario, Rancho Cucamonga and Hesperia. Specific areas were selected for enforcement by investigators, due to the high volume of activity and advertisements directly related to the commercial sex trafficking industry. The operations consisted of street level enforcement, on-line advertisements enforcement and a search warrant served at a high desert location, determined to be a commercial brothel.\nAt the end of the operational period, San Bernardino County Task Force members had successfully arrested 45 suspects. Of those arrests, one suspect who was contacted at an Ontario motel, was arrested for felony possession of a controlled substance while in possession of multiple and illegal firearms. During the operation, investigators also identified and successfully rescued 4 adult victims of commercial sex trafficking.\nhttps://local.nixle.com/alert/7083350/?sub_id=10614532\n\n#makingadifference #endhumantrafficking #leo #helperase", "cleaned_message": ["san", "bernardino", "counti", "sheriff", "depart", "nixl", "san", "bernardino", "counti", "human", "traffick", "task", "forc", "particip", "th", "annual", "oper", "reclaim", "rebuild", "enforc", "oper", "conjunct", "human", "traffick", "awar", "month", "san", "bernardino", "counti", "human", "traffick", "task", "forc", "particip", "fifth", "annual", "oper", "reclaim", "rebuild", "enforc", "oper", "organ", "lo", "angel", "region", "human", "traffick", "task", "forc", "feder", "state", "local", "law", "enforc", "agenc", "task", "forc", "across", "california", "particip", "three-day", "statewid", "effort", "aim", "combat", "human", "traffick", "took", "place", "thursday", "januari", "saturday", "januari", "conduct", "variou", "medium", "met", "posit", "result", "three", "day", "period", "san", "bernardino", "counti", "task", "forc", "conduct", "enforc", "oper", "consist", "-", "oper", "phase", "per", "day", "oper", "conduct", "throughout", "counti", "specif", "within", "citi", "san", "bernardino", "ontario", "rancho", "cucamonga", "hesperia", "specif", "area", "select", "enforc", "investig", "due", "high", "volum", "activ", "advertis", "directli", "relat", "commerci", "sex", "traffick", "industri", "oper", "consist", "street", "level", "enforc", "on-lin", "advertis", "enforc", "search", "warrant", "serv", "high", "desert", "locat", "determin", "commerci", "brothel", "end", "oper", "period", "san", "bernardino", "counti", "task", "forc", "member", "success", "arrest", "suspect", "arrest", "one", "suspect", "contact", "ontario", "motel", "arrest", "feloni", "possess", "control", "substanc", "possess", "multipl", "illeg", "firearm", "oper", "investig", "also", "identifi", "success", "rescu", "adult", "victim", "commerci", "sex", "traffick"], "emojis": null, "mentions": null, "names": null, "message_tags": ["San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department", "makingadifference", "endhumantrafficking", "Leo", "helpERASE"], "attachments": [{"media_type": "photo", "media_url": "https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/51087975_2223192027732460_2340044396432457728_o.jpg?_nc_cat=100&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=2d5d41&_nc_ohc=2MEkeSf86XAAX8dG8z6&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.xx&tp=6&oh=94b76575b14eebd39339740eeb1cb909&oe=606F11D0", "media_description": null, "thumbnail_url": null}], "urls": ["https://local.nixle.com/alert/7083350/?sub_id=10614532"]}
