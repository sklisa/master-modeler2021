San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, San Bernardino Police Department, City of Fontana Police Department, Redlands Police Department, San Bernardino County District Attorney's Office, State of California Probation, and Homeland Security Investigations sent officers/agents to participate. The class was filled with extremely dedicated men and women who are on the front lines in the fight against human trafficking. \nThank you DDA Tamara Ross, Assistant CASE Coordinator, Angel Magallanes, and Human Trafficking Advocate, Kelley Alsobrook for presenting to the class.  A big thank you to Dr. Kimberly Mehlman-Orozco for donating over 40 copies of Hidden in Plain Sight: America's Slaves of the New Millennium to the participants in the class. \n\nThe classes we provide law enforcement are not just about teaching tools and techniques, it's about changing mindset, building relationships and learning from one another. No one can win this battle on their own. We have to do it together.  \nWe look forward to working more with these agencies in the future.\n\nWe also want to thank the California National Guard Armory, San Bernardino Police Department and Sheriff\u2019s Employees\u2019 Benefit Association of San Bernardino County, SEBA for letting us use their training rooms.", "cleaned_message": ["last", "week", "honor", "san", "bernardino", "counti", "human", "traffick", "task", "forc", "host", "-day", "advanc", "human", "traffick", "law", "enforc", "class", "san", "bernardino", "counti", "sheriff", "depart", "san", "bernardino", "polic", "depart", "citi", "fontana", "polic", "depart", "redland", "polic", "depart", "san", "bernardino", "counti", "district", "attorney", "offic", "state", "california", "probat", "homeland", "secur", "investig", "sent", "offic", "agent", "particip", "class", "fill", "extrem", "dedic", "men", "women", "front", "line", "fight", "human", "traffick", "thank", "dda", "tamara", "ross", "assist", "case", "coordin", "angel", "magallan", "human", "traffick", "advoc", "kelley", "alsobrook", "present", "class", "big", "thank", "dr", "kimberli", "mehlman-orozco", "donat", "copi", "hidden", "plain", "sight", "america", "slave", "new", "millennium", "particip", "class", "class", "provid", "law", "enforc", "teach", "tool", "techniqu", "chang", "mindset", "build", "relationship", "learn", "one", "anoth", "one", "win", "battl", "togeth", "look", "forward", "work", "agenc", "futur", "also", "want", "thank", "california", "nation", "guard", "armori", "san", "bernardino", "polic", "depart", "sheriff", "employe", "benefit", "associ", "san", "bernardino", "counti", "seba", "let", "us", "use", "train", "room"], "emojis": null, "mentions": null, "names": ["Tamara Ross", "Angel Magallanes", "Kelley Alsobrook", "Kimberly Mehlman-Orozco"], "message_tags": ["San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department", "San Bernardino Police Department", "City of Fontana Police Department", "Redlands Police Department", "San Bernardino County District Attorney", "Dr. Kimberly Mehlman-Orozco", "Hidden in Plain Sight: America's Slaves of the New Millennium", "SEBA"], "attachments": [{"media_type": "photo", "media_url": "https://scontent-lax3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/31183458_1831112776940389_7766541339327463424_n.jpg?_nc_cat=106&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=XD2ijLpmCMYAX_xuNHX&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.xx&tp=7&oh=4f79343c4e201df9d94a38e20db1c578&oe=60708382", "media_description": null, "thumbnail_url": null}], "urls": null}
