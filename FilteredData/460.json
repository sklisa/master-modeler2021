This is a perfect example of why we have a Law Enforcement Program. ERASE provides direct services to individuals victimized by human traffickers and we know that Law Enforcement is key to getting traffickers behind bars. Law enforcement led instruction is essential in delivering the training needed by other law enforcement new to investigating human trafficking crimes. The training we have provided over the last several years was developed by instructors who have in-depth experience in working with human trafficking investigations. Additional speakers in the class have been subject matter experts on using a victim-centered/trauma-informed approach and the importance of community and family involvement. The classes we presented have made a positive impact in the neighborhoods of the attending agencies and have changed the lives of many who have been victimized by traffickers.
