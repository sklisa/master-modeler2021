It is a true honor to work with so many wonderful people representing Education, Government, Law Enforcement, Local Businesses, Non-Profits and concerned citizens. It is a collective effort to combat human trafficking and to keep our communities safe. Like someone said at the meeting yesterday, \"Its more than a Powerhouse, its a PowerMansion.\" Thank you Rachel Tourgeman and Maria Regueiro for making this possible. This ia only a small fraction of all the wonderful people that were there yesterday.", "cleaned_message": ["yesterday", "plan", "meet", "florida", "nation", "univers", "powerhous", "human", "traffick", "awar", "walk", "true", "honor", "work", "mani", "wonder", "peopl", "repres", "educ", "govern", "law", "enforc", "local", "busi", "non-profit", "concern", "citizen", "collect", "effort", "combat", "human", "traffick", "keep", "commun", "safe", "like", "someon", "said", "meet", "yesterday", "powerhous", "powermans", "thank", "rachel", "tourgeman", "maria", "regueiro", "make", "possibl", "ia", "small", "fraction", "wonder", "peopl", "yesterday"], "emojis": null, "mentions": null, "names": ["Rachel Tourgeman", "Maria Regueiro"], "message_tags": ["Florida National University", "Rachel Tourgeman", "Maria C Regueiro"], "attachments": [{"media_type": "photo", "media_url": "https://www.facebook.com/helperase/photos/a.1029649477086727/1665592936825708/?type=3", "media_description": null, "thumbnail_url": null}], "urls": null}
