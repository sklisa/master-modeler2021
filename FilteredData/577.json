Thank you @danicamckellar\nYesterday was #WorldDayAgainstTrafficking... people wore blue and posted about modern day slavery. For several hours I read and researched and also talked to my good friend @jen_lilley who is a foster mom and strong advocate for children. Yesterday was my day for learning, so I could post today...\nLet's shine a light on this multi-billion dollar (and the fastest growing) criminal industry in the world - and increasing at an even faster pace because of our lockdown response to the pandemic. I'm not going to go into detail about what happens to these slaves, but it's devastating, and about a third of them are children. And more than you'd think is happening right here in the U.S., some hiding in plain sight. \ud83d\ude14\n.\nIt's not comfortable to think about, but heck, nothing in 2020 feels comfortable anyway, so why not educate ourselves and be a positive force??\n.\nOnce upon a time, slavery was legal in this country. So many citizens chose to ignore the devastation happening right in front of them.\n.\nLet's not be those people who chose to ignore slavery because it's uncomfortable. Modern day slavery is real, it's horrific, and needs our attention and advocacy. \n.\nWhat can we do? \n.\nAwareness: We can follow accounts like @ourrescue, @a21, @helperase, @uheroes, @thorn and more, to become aware and familiar *over time* and to see the heroic work they are doing - leave them comments, periodically share their posts with your followers... they will truly appreciate your involvement!\n.\nVolunteer: Foster kids without a positive force in their lives are *far* more likely to become victims of trafficking. Becoming a child advocate for a foster child through CASA (link in bio) is an incredible gift, as is mentoring a high-risk child through a program like @bgca_clubs or @bbbsamerica. These are the most valuable and heroic acts you could take, aside from actually becoming a foster parent. \u2764\n.\nDonate: Of course, all of these organizations are working hard and donations keep them going!\n.\nIf you've taken the time to read all of this, THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart.
