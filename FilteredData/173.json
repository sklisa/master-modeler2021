While Department of Homeland Security is losing a very dedicated agent, the Anti-Human Trafficking Community is gaining a very strong voice! As Victor has reassured us, he is leaving his position but not the fight against human trafficking. \n\nThank you, Victor, for attending so many amazing events all around the world. Thank you for educating children and their parents. Thank you for speaking at churches and community events. Thank you for sharing your experiences and passion with others in law enforcement officers. (We don't think the word \u201cNo\u201d is in your vocabulary.) Thank you for always answering the phone and being a liaison for areas outside of Florida. And most of all, thank you for standing up and protecting trafficking victims and survivors. \n\nIn your 35 years of public service, you have made an impact on thousands of people's lives, including ours. There is no doubt in the coming years you will impact thousands more. \nCongratulations on your retirement and good luck as you begin your next journey.  \nvimeo.com/249041801", "cleaned_message": ["today", "south", "florida", "human", "traffick", "task", "forc", "say", "goodby", "coordin", "sa", "victor", "william", "retir", "depart", "homeland", "secur", "lose", "dedic", "agent", "anti-human", "traffick", "commun", "gain", "strong", "voic", "victor", "reassur", "us", "leav", "posit", "fight", "human", "traffick", "thank", "victor", "attend", "mani", "amaz", "event", "around", "world", "thank", "educ", "children", "parent", "thank", "speak", "church", "commun", "event", "thank", "share", "experi", "passion", "law", "enforc", "offic", "think", "word", "vocabulari", "thank", "alway", "answer", "phone", "liaison", "area", "outsid", "florida", "thank", "stand", "protect", "traffick", "victim", "survivor", "year", "public", "servic", "made", "impact", "thousand", "peopl", "live", "includ", "doubt", "come", "year", "impact", "thousand", "congratul", "retir", "good", "luck", "begin", "next", "journey", "vimeo", "com"], "emojis": null, "mentions": null, "names": ["Victor Williams", "Victor", "Victor"], "message_tags": ["South Florida Human Trafficking Task Force", "Victor Williams", "Department of Homeland Security"], "attachments": [{"media_type": "share", "media_url": "https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fvimeo.com%2F249041801&h=AT3w8UHwAy76q75IVVUNulB2lpLjjbpiLDCJc8PjBCc-yas1LgB-NrXCKjzhQgV0EDiLULtdcTmaTSffU28DFaZ_Y_ODxG6UoPFR0XCHHTHkDc3_r9-nEhUBipi6Y-Hc&s=1", "media_description": "Congratulations on your retirement Victor!", "thumbnail_url": null}], "urls": null}
