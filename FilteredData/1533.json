They are then forced into labor under the guise of legal employment.  Agricultural, hospitality, domestic service, construction, and restaurants are common fields where people can be exploited. Temporary work visas are often tied to a single employer, if the person leaves that employer, they can be deported. Deportation is a threat used by traffickers to maintain control over their victims. #labor #trafficking", "cleaned_message": ["often", "labor", "traffick", "victim", "enter", "us", "legal", "temporari", "work", "visa", "forc", "labor", "guis", "legal", "employ", "agricultur", "hospit", "domest", "servic", "construct", "restaur", "common", "field", "peopl", "exploit", "temporari", "work", "visa", "often", "tie", "singl", "employ", "person", "leav", "employ", "deport", "deport", "threat", "use", "traffick", "maintain", "control", "victim"], "emojis": null, "mentions": null, "names": null, "message_tags": ["labor", "trafficking"], "attachments": [{"media_type": "photo", "media_url": "https://www.facebook.com/helperase/photos/a.1029649477086727/3794902220561425/?type=3", "media_description": "Timeline Photos", "thumbnail_url": null}], "urls": null}
