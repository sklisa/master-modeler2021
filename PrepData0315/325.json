For starters, the lack of action taken by the college and the fact the teacher was put on paid leave. The most concerning parts are the number of complaints and how long before someone came forward. \nIf you have a young person in your life, please talk with them. Let them know they can speak out and they will be heard by you. Let them know what is acceptable and what isn't. If you're not comfortable having that conversation then ask for guidance.
