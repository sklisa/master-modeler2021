Human trafficking is a barbaric human rights abuse that thrives on greed, secrecy, a perverted sense of entitlement to exploit the vulnerable and an unimaginable disregard for the victims. As the author of five comprehensive laws to combat human trafficking\u2013\u2013including the landmark Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA)\u2014which marks 20 years of success this year\u2013\u2013 I urge everyone to redouble their efforts and step up, bolster, and renew our commitment to eradicate the scourge of human trafficking once and for all.\n\nUnfortunately, COVID-19 has made our anti-human trafficking work more challenging\u2014especially as predators groom more children online, traffickers and those they exploit become even more invisible, and jobs evaporate for rescued victims making them more susceptible to being trafficked.\n\nYou can help break the cycle of human trafficking. \n\nCall the National Human Trafficking Hotline: \u202a1-888-373-7888 if you or someone you know is a victim of human trafficking or to report a tip on suspected trafficking activity.\n\n#endhumantrafficking #humanrights #trafficking", "cleaned_message": ["today", "recogn", "day", "rais", "awar", "redoubl", "effort", "protect", "weak", "vulner", "popul", "sex", "labor", "traffick", "human", "traffick", "barbar", "human", "right", "abus", "thrive", "greed", "secreci", "pervert", "sens", "entitl", "exploit", "vulner", "unimagin", "disregard", "victim", "author", "five", "comprehens", "law", "combat", "human", "traffick", "includ", "landmark", "traffick", "victim", "protect", "act", "tvpa", "mark", "year", "success", "year", "urg", "everyon", "redoubl", "effort", "step", "bolster", "renew", "commit", "erad", "scourg", "human", "traffick", "unfortun", "covid-", "made", "anti-human", "traffick", "work", "challeng", "especi", "predat", "groom", "children", "onlin", "traffick", "exploit", "becom", "even", "invis", "job", "evapor", "rescu", "victim", "make", "suscept", "traffick", "help", "break", "cycl", "human", "traffick", "call", "nation", "human", "traffick", "hotlin", "-", "-", "-", "someon", "know", "victim", "human", "traffick", "report", "tip", "suspect", "traffick", "activ"], "emojis": null, "mentions": ["repchrissmith"], "names": null, "message_tags": ["Repost", "WorldDayAgainstHumanTrafficking", "endhumantrafficking", "humanrights", "trafficking"], "attachments": [{"media_type": "photo", "media_url": "https://www.facebook.com/helperase/photos/a.1029649477086727/3345461435505508/?type=3", "media_description": "Timeline Photos", "thumbnail_url": null}], "urls": null, "date": "2020-07-31", "day_week": 4, "Mon": 0, "Tue": 0, "Wed": 0, "Thur": 0, "Fri": 1, "Sat": 0, "winter": 0, "spring": 0, "summer": 1, "hour": 4, "morning": 0, "afternoon": 0, "evening": 0, "share": 0, "share_url": null, "photo": 1, "photo_url": "https://www.facebook.com/helperase/photos/a.1029649477086727/3345461435505508/?type=3", "video": 0, "video_url": null, "media_desc": ["Timeline Photos"], "thumbnail_url": [null], "link": 0, "link_url": null, "total engagement": 20, "engagement rate": 42.22081486, "reactions": 8, "shares": 12, "comments": 0}
