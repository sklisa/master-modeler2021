I had the opportunity to see the work the students have been dedicating their time to this semester. \nWe are very lucky to work with this amazing, intelligent, creative and passionate group of students. We can't wait for everyone to see the projects they've  created to help educate parents and children about child trafficking. \n#inspired \n#creatingchange", "cleaned_message": ["yesterday", "pleasur", "meet", "young", "hungri", "creativ", "co-op", "creativ", "director", "jim", "wojtowicz", "vendela", "ngek", "student", "project", "lead", "collabor", "opportun", "see", "work", "student", "dedic", "time", "semest", "lucki", "work", "amaz", "intellig", "creativ", "passion", "group", "student", "wait", "everyon", "see", "project", "creat", "help", "educ", "parent", "children", "child", "traffick"], "emojis": null, "mentions": null, "names": ["Jim Wojtowicz", "Vendela"], "message_tags": ["Young & Hungry Creative Lab", "inspired", "creatingchange"], "attachments": [{"media_type": "photo", "media_url": "https://www.facebook.com/helperase/photos/a.1029649477086727/1421642387887432/?type=3", "media_description": "Timeline Photos", "thumbnail_url": null}], "urls": null, "date": "2017-03-30", "day_week": 3, "Mon": 0, "Tue": 0, "Wed": 0, "Thur": 1, "Fri": 0, "Sat": 0, "winter": 0, "spring": 1, "summer": 0, "hour": 14, "morning": 0, "afternoon": 1, "evening": 0, "share": 0, "share_url": null, "photo": 1, "photo_url": "https://www.facebook.com/helperase/photos/a.1029649477086727/1421642387887432/?type=3", "video": 0, "video_url": null, "media_desc": ["Timeline Photos"], "thumbnail_url": [null], "link": 0, "link_url": null, "total engagement": 9, "engagement rate": 62.63048017, "reactions": 6, "shares": 2, "comments": 1}
