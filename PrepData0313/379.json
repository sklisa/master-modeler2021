This year, the UNODC is focusing on the responses to child and youth trafficking around the world. Thousands of men, women, and children have their rights, freedoms, and dignity stolen from them at the hands of human traffickers who prey on their vulnerability. Almost one-third of these victims are children, and women and girls make up 71% of the total demographic. Victims come from a range of situations, including the need to escape armed conflict, sexual exploitation, modern slavery, and organ removal. \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\nBut it doesn't have to be this way. Together, we can raise awareness, call out and punish those who are accountable, and support the protection and justice of children and youths affected by the heinous crime of human trafficking.\u201d (Via @amnestynsw ) \u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\u2800\n#humantrafficking #endhumantrafficking #worlddayagainsttraffickinginpersons #childrensrights #humanrights", "cleaned_message": ["juli", "th", "annual", "world", "day", "traffick", "person", "year", "unodc", "focus", "respons", "child", "youth", "traffick", "around", "world", "thousand", "men", "women", "children", "right", "freedom", "digniti", "stolen", "hand", "human", "traffick", "prey", "vulner", "almost", "one-third", "victim", "children", "women", "girl", "make", "total", "demograph", "victim", "come", "rang", "situat", "includ", "need", "escap", "arm", "conflict", "sexual", "exploit", "modern", "slaveri", "organ", "remov", "way", "togeth", "rais", "awar", "call", "punish", "account", "support", "protect", "justic", "children", "youth", "affect", "heinou", "crime", "human", "traffick", "via"], "emojis": null, "mentions": ["amnestytoronto", "amnestynsw"], "names": null, "message_tags": ["Repost", "humantrafficking", "endhumantrafficking", "WorldDayAgainstTraffickinginPersons", "childrensrights", "humanrights"], "attachments": [{"media_type": "photo", "media_url": "https://www.facebook.com/helperase/photos/a.1029649477086727/1956210921097240/?type=3", "media_description": "Timeline Photos", "thumbnail_url": null}], "urls": null, "date": "2018-07-30", "day_week": 0, "Mon": 1, "Tue": 0, "Wed": 0, "Thur": 0, "Fri": 0, "Sat": 0, "event": 1, "winter": 0, "spring": 0, "summer": 1, "hour": 23, "morning": 0, "afternoon": 0, "evening": 1, "share": 0, "share_url": null, "photo": 1, "photo_url": "https://www.facebook.com/helperase/photos/a.1029649477086727/1956210921097240/?type=3", "video": 0, "video_url": null, "media_desc": ["Timeline Photos"], "thumbnail_url": [null], "link": 0, "link_url": null, "total_engagement": 41, "engagement_rate": 158.1790123, "reactions": 23, "shares": 18, "comments": 0}
