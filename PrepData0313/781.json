It is the exploitation of human beings for involuntary sex or labor. In robbing its victims of their liberty and autonomy, it is as morally repugnant as slavery in any other form. It treats human beings as commodities to be bought and sold.\nWhile its vileness places human trafficking on the level of slavery, it presents a unique set of challenges. It is a crime that remains hidden, with victims trapped in a spiraling cycle of brutality, abuse and repression, unless and until someone helps to rescue them.", "cleaned_message": ["human", "traffick", "slaveri", "exploit", "human", "involuntari", "sex", "labor", "rob", "victim", "liberti", "autonomi", "moral", "repugn", "slaveri", "form", "treat", "human", "commod", "bought", "sold", "vile", "place", "human", "traffick", "level", "slaveri", "present", "uniqu", "set", "challeng", "crime", "remain", "hidden", "victim", "trap", "spiral", "cycl", "brutal", "abus", "repress", "unless", "someon", "help", "rescu"], "emojis": null, "mentions": null, "names": null, "message_tags": null, "attachments": [{"media_type": "share", "media_url": "http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fj.mp%2F2mUT20W&h=AT2fGi4S2s2Zedb1XqCkwDAxwdhOSJIFgDVzk-fGJgfExxN6zoBapzqdlvvG2XDPCSgneB9bNj6PvGRJ3TJfacHqfJgc1j9Hd3z-yyF6D4l18HkaLH2NrHpsSckTc3BT&s=1", "media_description": "\u2018Be the One\u2019 to fight human trafficking", "thumbnail_url": "https://external-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQEXJCLfYFJykLEy&w=720&h=720&url=http%3A%2F%2Fww2.hdnux.com%2Fphotos%2F70%2F67%2F14%2F14906137%2F3%2FrawImage.jpg&cfs=1&sx=238&sy=0&sw=1317&sh=1317&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQEKUCK0cE7WUdef"}], "urls": null, "original_date": "23 Jan, 2018 10:14", "total_engagement": 20, "engagement_rate": 93.45794393, "reactions": 8, "shares": 12, "comments": 0, "date": "2018-01-23", "day_week": 1, "Mon": 0, "Tue": 1, "Wed": 0, "Thur": 0, "Fri": 0, "Sat": 0, "event": 1, "season": 0, "winter": 1, "spring": 0, "summer": 0, "hour": 10, "time_day": 1, "morning": 1, "afternoon": 0, "evening": 0, "emoji_num": 0, "mention_num": 0, "name_num": 0, "share": 1, "share_url": "http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fj.mp%2F2mUT20W&h=AT2fGi4S2s2Zedb1XqCkwDAxwdhOSJIFgDVzk-fGJgfExxN6zoBapzqdlvvG2XDPCSgneB9bNj6PvGRJ3TJfacHqfJgc1j9Hd3z-yyF6D4l18HkaLH2NrHpsSckTc3BT&s=1", "photo": 0, "photo_url": null, "video": 0, "video_url": null, "media_desc": "\u2018Be the One\u2019 to fight human trafficking", "thumbnail_url": "https://external-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQEXJCLfYFJykLEy&w=720&h=720&url=http%3A%2F%2Fww2.hdnux.com%2Fphotos%2F70%2F67%2F14%2F14906137%2F3%2FrawImage.jpg&cfs=1&sx=238&sy=0&sw=1317&sh=1317&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQEKUCK0cE7WUdef", "link": 0}
