Project GOLD serves girls ages 13 to 18 who have had involvement in commercial sexual exploitation. Many of the girls are in foster care; some are living at home with a parent or other caregiver. They are predominantly low income, from ethnic and racial minority groups, and many with emotional or learning disabilities. Nearly all have suffered childhood sexual abuse and many running away from some other trauma or abusive situation. #humantrafficking #humantraffickingawareness #january #kristihouse #projectgold #stopsextrafficking\n#Powerful #truth", "cleaned_message": ["via", "kristi", "hous", "rainbow", "butterfli", "spoken", "word", "poem", "written", "perform", "project", "gold", "client", "age", "project", "gold", "serv", "girl", "age", "involv", "commerci", "sexual", "exploit", "mani", "girl", "foster", "care", "live", "home", "parent", "caregiv", "predominantli", "low", "incom", "ethnic", "racial", "minor", "group", "mani", "emot", "learn", "disabl", "nearli", "suffer", "childhood", "sexual", "abus", "mani", "run", "away", "trauma", "abus", "situat"], "emojis": null, "mentions": null, "names": ["Rainbows"], "message_tags": ["Kristi House", "humantrafficking", "humantraffickingawareness", "january", "kristihouse", "ProjectGold", "stopSexTrafficking", "powerful", "truth"], "attachments": null, "urls": null, "date": "2018-01-11", "day_week": 3, "Mon": 0, "Tue": 0, "Wed": 0, "Thur": 1, "Fri": 0, "Sat": 0, "winter": 1, "spring": 0, "summer": 0, "hour": 14, "morning": 0, "afternoon": 1, "evening": 0, "share": 0, "share_url": null, "photo": 0, "photo_url": null, "video": 0, "video_url": null, "media_desc": [], "thumbnail_url": [], "link": 0, "link_url": null, "total engagement": 3, "engagement rate": 14.21800948, "reactions": 3, "shares": 0, "comments": 0}
