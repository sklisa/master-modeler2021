This is not a normal venue for a Human Trafficking Panel. However, #SummitLive is going outside the box to give a voice to a problem that most do not want to discuss..child sex trafficking. Thanks to Summit Live and Ryan Bell we have a panel of experts from areas where human trafficking is at its worst.\n\nThe knowledge that our speakers bring to the conversation is immeasurable. We are bringing law enforcement and social media together to spread awareness about child trafficking to an audience that potentially can reach hundreds of thousands of people. \n\nCalifornia and Florida are in the top three states with the highest incidents of human trafficking. We have speakers representing task forces from both states.  We also have a social media expert who also happens to be the founder of Summit Live and a live streamer and child advocate who is passionate about spreading awareness about child trafficking.  And bridging the gap is a law enforcement officer who specializes in training LE and other public safety professionals on how to use social media at their respective agencies.\n\nOur panel-\nCpt. Chris Marks, Captain of Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Human Trafficking Bureau and the LA Regional Human Trafficking Task Force, SA Victor Williams, Special Agent Williams is assigned to the Office of the Special Agent in Charge Miami, Human Trafficking Group and Coordinator for the South Florida Human Trafficking Task Force, Ryan Anderson Bell \nSgt.Marc Marty & Karena Steir", "cleaned_message": ["la", "area", "next", "week", "fortun", "host", "panel", "summit", "live", "normal", "venu", "human", "traffick", "panel", "howev", "go", "outsid", "box", "give", "voic", "problem", "want", "discuss", "child", "sex", "traffick", "thank", "summit", "live", "ryan", "bell", "panel", "expert", "area", "human", "traffick", "worst", "knowledg", "speaker", "bring", "convers", "immeasur", "bring", "law", "enforc", "social", "media", "togeth", "spread", "awar", "child", "traffick", "audienc", "potenti", "reach", "hundr", "thousand", "peopl", "california", "florida", "top", "three", "state", "highest", "incid", "human", "traffick", "speaker", "repres", "task", "forc", "state", "also", "social", "media", "expert", "also", "happen", "founder", "summit", "live", "live", "streamer", "child", "advoc", "passion", "spread", "awar", "child", "traffick", "bridg", "gap", "law", "enforc", "offic", "special", "train", "le", "public", "safeti", "profession", "use", "social", "media", "respect", "agenc", "panel-", "cpt", "chri", "mark", "captain", "lo", "angel", "counti", "sheriff", "depart", "human", "traffick", "bureau", "la", "region", "human", "traffick", "task", "forc", "sa", "victor", "william", "special", "agent", "william", "assign", "offic", "special", "agent", "charg", "miami", "human", "traffick", "group", "coordin", "south", "florida", "human", "traffick", "task", "forc", "ryan", "anderson", "bell", "sgt", "marc", "marti", "karena", "steir"], "emojis": null, "mentions": null, "names": ["Cpt", "Chris Marks", "Victor Williams", "Williams", "Ryan Anderson Bell", "Karena Steir"], "message_tags": ["SummitLive", "Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department", "Victor Williams", "South Florida Human Trafficking Task Force", "Marc Marty", "Karena Steir", "SummitLive"], "attachments": [{"media_type": "photo", "media_url": "https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p480x480/16819255_1382572928461045_7532220969006458023_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=2d5d41&_nc_ohc=uv3arPWkzcAAX9dIsj8&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.xx&tp=6&oh=5455ee9568e3a2159b5736d55e7360f5&oe=606F68BA", "media_description": null, "thumbnail_url": null}], "urls": null, "original_date": "19 Feb, 2017 15:17", "total_engagement": 14, "engagement_rate": 105.8201058, "reactions": 8, "shares": 6, "comments": 0, "date": "2017-02-19", "day_week": 6, "Mon": 0, "Tue": 0, "Wed": 0, "Thur": 0, "Fri": 0, "Sat": 0, "event": 0, "season": 0, "winter": 1, "spring": 0, "summer": 0, "hour": 15, "time_day": 2, "morning": 0, "afternoon": 1, "evening": 0, "emoji_num": 0, "mention_num": 0, "name_num": 6, "share": 0, "share_url": null, "photo": 1, "photo_url": "https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-0/p480x480/16819255_1382572928461045_7532220969006458023_o.jpg?_nc_cat=103&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=2d5d41&_nc_ohc=uv3arPWkzcAAX9dIsj8&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.xx&tp=6&oh=5455ee9568e3a2159b5736d55e7360f5&oe=606F68BA", "video": 0, "video_url": null, "media_desc": null, "thumbnail_url": null, "link": 0}
