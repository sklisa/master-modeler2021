On April 7 two human traffickers will be sentenced for the heinous crimes they committed against the survivors. We need to fill the courtroom and show there is a community that stands with survivors and we will not tolerate people being treating as property. We need to let the Judge know that these men deserve the maximum sentence possible and we donäó»t want them back on our streets. Court details below.

Please share, tag your friends, ask anyone you know in the area to join in supporting the survivors. If you cannot make it please leave a comment showing your support for the survivors. 

This week is National Crime Victims' Rights Week. äóÖThis yearäó»s themeäóîStrength. Resilience. Justice.äóîreflects a vision for the future in which all victims are strengthened by the response they receive, organizations are resilient in response to challenges, and communities are able to seek collective justice and healing.äóť

äó˘Depression

äó˘Posttraumatic stress disorders and anxiety disorders
äó˘Suicidal thoughts
A recent study found that human trafficking survivors have an alarming higher-than-average rate of suicidal thoughts with a percentage of 23% of survivors having attempted suicide, compared with 3% of the population with no prior domestic violence exposure.

If you are someone you know are experiencing suicidal thoughts, whether they are human trafficking victims are not, here are some things you can do:
äó˘Be a good listener instead of being judgemental
äó˘Encourage them to seek help from Psychologists and mental health professionals
äó˘Help them build strong relationships with others outside of an abusive environment
äó˘Help them connect with support groups and other community resources
Call the Suicide Prevention Hotline listed below:

Chances are it was both. What we do know is that people lost their lives because someone did not value the lives of all the people in the back of that truck. Greed/Money became more important than a person's life. That is a reoccurring theme in Human Trafficking. This is a problem that effects all communities all across the country. 

The Walmart employee that provided the water and then called the police probably saved many lives. Sometimes the simplest act can make a difference. Together we can make a difference. Together we can be a voice to the voiceless.

Did you know that around 60% of all child sex trafficking victims have histories in the child welfare system? We work with adults and almost half of the women we work with were in the foster care system and aged out. Children without families to make them feel loved, cared for, and protected are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by traffickers. _ôÍî
This adorable coffee shop just opened up in Dallas, TX and employees youth that have aged out of the foster care system. Jobs are a huge barrier for the women we work with for many reasons. This is a huge step in the right direction and we canäó»t wait to see the positive impact this establishment will have in decreasing the trafficking stats for these individuals in our area! _ô»ë_ôŹé

In conjunction with Human Trafficking Awareness Month, the San Bernardino County Human Trafficking Task Force participated in the fifth annual äóÖOperation Reclaim and Rebuildäó» enforcement operation, organized by the Los Angeles Regional Human Trafficking Task Force. More than 90 federal, state and local law enforcement agencies and task forces from across California participated.
The three-day, statewide effort aimed at combatting human trafficking, took place between Thursday, January 24, and Saturday, January 26, 2019, and was conducted in various mediums and met with positive results. Over the three day period, the San Bernardino County Task Force conducted enforcement operations consisting of 2-3 operational phases per day. Operations were conducted throughout the county and specifically within the cities of San Bernardino, Ontario, Rancho Cucamonga and Hesperia. Specific areas were selected for enforcement by investigators, due to the high volume of activity and advertisements directly related to the commercial sex trafficking industry. The operations consisted of street level enforcement, on-line advertisements enforcement and a search warrant served at a high desert location, determined to be a commercial brothel.
At the end of the operational period, San Bernardino County Task Force members had successfully arrested 45 suspects. Of those arrests, one suspect who was contacted at an Ontario motel, was arrested for felony possession of a controlled substance while in possession of multiple and illegal firearms. During the operation, investigators also identified and successfully rescued 4 adult victims of commercial sex trafficking.

äóěJuly 30th is the annual World Day Against Trafficking in Persons. This year, the UNODC is focusing on the responses to child and youth trafficking around the world. Thousands of men, women, and children have their rights, freedoms, and dignity stolen from them at the hands of human traffickers who prey on their vulnerability. Almost one-third of these victims are children, and women and girls make up 71% of the total demographic. Victims come from a range of situations, including the need to escape armed conflict, sexual exploitation, modern slavery, and organ removal. äćóäćóäćóäćóäćóäćóäćóäćóäćó
But it doesn't have to be this way. Together, we can raise awareness, call out and punish those who are accountable, and support the protection and justice of children and youths affected by the heinous crime of human trafficking.äóť (Via @amnestynsw ) äćóäćóäćóäćóäćóäćóäćóäćóäćó

ERASE provides direct services to individuals victimized by human traffickers and we know that Law Enforcement is key to getting traffickers behind bars. Law enforcement led instruction is essential in delivering the training needed by other law enforcement new to investigating human trafficking crimes. The training we have provided over the last several years was developed by instructors who have in-depth experience in working with human trafficking investigations. Additional speakers in the class have been subject matter experts on using a victim-centered/trauma-informed approach and the importance of community and family involvement. The classes we presented have made a positive impact in the neighborhoods of the attending agencies and have changed the lives of many who have been victimized by traffickers.

Yesterday was #WorldDayAgainstTrafficking... people wore blue and posted about modern day slavery. For several hours I read and researched and also talked to my good friend @jen_lilley who is a foster mom and strong advocate for children. Yesterday was my day for learning, so I could post today...
Let's shine a light on this multi-billion dollar (and the fastest growing) criminal industry in the world - and increasing at an even faster pace because of our lockdown response to the pandemic. I'm not going to go into detail about what happens to these slaves, but it's devastating, and about a third of them are children. And more than you'd think is happening right here in the U.S., some hiding in plain sight. _ôÖî
.
It's not comfortable to think about, but heck, nothing in 2020 feels comfortable anyway, so why not educate ourselves and be a positive force??
.
Once upon a time, slavery was legal in this country. So many citizens chose to ignore the devastation happening right in front of them.
.
Let's not be those people who chose to ignore slavery because it's uncomfortable. Modern day slavery is real, it's horrific, and needs our attention and advocacy. 
.
What can we do? 
.
Awareness: We can follow accounts like @ourrescue, @a21, @helperase, @uheroes, @thorn and more, to become aware and familiar *over time* and to see the heroic work they are doing - leave them comments, periodically share their posts with your followers... they will truly appreciate your involvement!
.
Volunteer: Foster kids without a positive force in their lives are *far* more likely to become victims of trafficking. Becoming a child advocate for a foster child through CASA (link in bio) is an incredible gift, as is mentoring a high-risk child through a program like @bgca_clubs or @bbbsamerica. These are the most valuable and heroic acts you could take, aside from actually becoming a foster parent. äť_
.
Donate: Of course, all of these organizations are working hard and donations keep them going!
.

We are still hoping to have 40 people to show support. @karenasteir and her daughter Mia are walking a half marathon covered in Band-Aids decorated by YOU. 
Did we mention she lives in Iowa?! Itäó»s going to be cold! To donate and show support head over to our Facebook page @HelpERASE and you will see the Band-Aid Fundraiser. 
This is a message from Karena. 
CHILDREN LOVE BAND-AIDS
They know people SEE their pain with a Band-Aid.
They feel CARED for when they get a Band-Aid. 
They can HEAL once they have a Band-Aid.
These feelings match how we want to approach our Human Trafficking victims, survivors and conquerors. We want them to know they are SEEN, we want them to feel CARED for and we want to help them HEAL. 
This year I am doing a fundraiser for ERASE Child Trafficking - a US based non-profit dedicated to educating communities, recovering victims and providing aftercare to survivors. Their vast reach and intense involvement in this field is unmatched. The ERASE team can be found nationwide training law enforement, speaking at public events, acquiring housing & transporation for survivors as well as many other behind-the-scene duties.
Being a part of ERASE, I've seen first hand how far even the smallest of donations can go. A donation of $5 may buy lunch for a survivor on her first day of freedom. A donation of $10 may get him basic toiletries for his new life. A donation of $50 may get him a bus pass or basic cell phone. A donation of $100 may help her acquire a new wardrobe. A donation of $425 pays for the full training of a law enforcement individual learning the lastest tips, technology and mindsets in the fight against Human Trafficking.

This year I'm asking for help getting victims, survivors & conquerors 
SEEN, CARED FOR & HEALED. 
I'm asking YOU to be a Band-Aid.
My goal is to find 100 donors willing to kick in $5 (the lowest amount FB is willing to process) in an effort to show our community cares. Will you buy a $5 Band-Aid?

We need to turn the tables and use social media to raise awareness. 

We are asking you to do your own live stream, take over our 
FB /IG/Twitter live stream, record a short video which we will share or be a guest on our FB Livestream. 

Talk about human trafficking, it can be as simple as sharing the signs of human trafficking, talk about your fight against human trafficking, or share the work that you or your non-profit is doing. 

Join us throughout the rest of the month in shedding light on this epidemic.

If you would like to live stream from our page send us a message. If you do a live stream from your page please use #GiveFreedom & #HelpERASE and we will share onto our page.

Today, we recognize #WorldDayAgainstHumanTrafficking, a day to raise awareness and redouble our efforts to protect weak and vulnerable populations from sex or labor trafficking. Human trafficking is a barbaric human rights abuse that thrives on greed, secrecy, a perverted sense of entitlement to exploit the vulnerable and an unimaginable disregard for the victims. As the author of five comprehensive laws to combat human traffickingäóńäóńincluding the landmark Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA)äóîwhich marks 20 years of success this yearäóńäóń I urge everyone to redouble their efforts and step up, bolster, and renew our commitment to eradicate the scourge of human trafficking once and for all.

Unfortunately, COVID-19 has made our anti-human trafficking work more challengingäóîespecially as predators groom more children online, traffickers and those they exploit become even more invisible, and jobs evaporate for rescued victims making them more susceptible to being trafficked.

You can help break the cycle of human trafficking. 

Call the National Human Trafficking Hotline: äóČ1-888-373-7888 if you or someone you know is a victim of human trafficking or to report a tip on suspected trafficking activity.

äóěHuman trafficking isnäó»t exclusive to big events, itäó»s happening 365 days a year.äóť

Judge Paul Herbert started the CATCH (Changing Actions To Change Habits) Court in 2009 here in Columbus in response to an overwhelming number of domestic violence and prostitution cases coming before the court. As he educated himself on the subject, he found the issue, in part, was rooted in early childhood domestic sexual abuse. 

The thought that women sell their bodies because they are addicted to drugs is not the truth. Victims of early childhood sexual abuse experience trauma that makes them more susceptible to drugs and further victimization from men all around the world looking to make money off of them. 

1/3 of women in prostitution start before they are 15 years old. 66% start before their 18th birthday. For women who have entered CATCH Court, the average age for when they first faced sexual abuse is 8.5 years old.

This is not a normal venue for a Human Trafficking Panel. However, #SummitLive is going outside the box to give a voice to a problem that most do not want to discuss..child sex trafficking. Thanks to Summit Live and Ryan Bell we have a panel of experts from areas where human trafficking is at its worst.

The knowledge that our speakers bring to the conversation is immeasurable. We are bringing law enforcement and social media together to spread awareness about child trafficking to an audience that potentially can reach hundreds of thousands of people. 

California and Florida are in the top three states with the highest incidents of human trafficking. We have speakers representing task forces from both states.  We also have a social media expert who also happens to be the founder of Summit Live and a live streamer and child advocate who is passionate about spreading awareness about child trafficking.  And bridging the gap is a law enforcement officer who specializes in training LE and other public safety professionals on how to use social media at their respective agencies.

Our panel-

Chris Marks, Captain of Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Human Trafficking Bureau and the LA Regional Human Trafficking Task Force, SA Victor Williams, Special Agent Williams is assigned to the Office of the Special Agent in Charge Miami, Human Trafficking Group and Coordinator for the South Florida Human Trafficking Task Force, Ryan Anderson Bell

In April 2018, a brave victim spoke out against her trafficker for the first time while in a hospital in San Bernardino County being treated for her injuries caused by him.  Other victims were identified through the investigation and BRANDON LEWIS was arrested and brought to justice.  Yesterday he was sentenced to 73 years 4 months in state prison. During the sentencing, the judge provided his thoughts on LEWISäó» behavior and stated that LEWIS treated the victims as products to be used for his own pleasure and financial gain.  #humantraffickingawarenessmonth #education #prevention #justice #sanbernardino",12,25.33248892,8,3,1

I've been blessed to participate in many ways in the fight against slavery. I didn't know what to do. I didn't know how to do it. However, when I was asked, I did something. 

I've had a part in changing lives... Saving people from their captors and helping others into recovery. When I'm lying on my deathbed, this will not be a regret.

Over the past year in addition to FL we have held several classes in NC, NJ, CA, and NY. We have had over 167 agencies from local, state, federal agencies, and tribal police send participants. 
Last month we marked our one year of classes in the Los Angeles area, at Montebello Police Department and next month we are heading back to south Florida. We have learned so much valuable information along the way and continue to make changes to the curriculum. 
Our primary goal with this program has always been to assist law enforcement with the tools and techniques they need to detect and investigate human trafficking crimes. We are grateful to  Thorn and Callyo for sharing their great products during the class. 
Over the past year we have had amazing instructors, presenters, and guest speakers. Most of all we have made great connections and friends with law enforcement officers who are in the fight against human trafficking.

July 30th is #worlddayagainsttraffickinginpersons. Human Trafficking occurs all over the world, including in Texas.
äćóäćóäćóäćóäćó
Combatting it requires international, national, state, and local action. There are an estimated 40.3 million victims of human trafficking worldwide.
äćóäćóäćóäćóäćó
RSTäó»s Anti-Trafficking programs provide services to survivors of human trafficking across Texas. Donate to help a survivor in need at www.rstx.org/donate

Juneteenth (a portmanteau of June and nineteenth;[2] also known as Freedom Day,[3] Jubilee Day,[4] and Liberation Day[5]) started as a Texas state holiday, but is now celebrated annually on the 19th of June throughout the United States to commemorate Union army general Gordon Granger announcing federal orders in the city of Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865, proclaiming that all slaves in Texas were now free.[6] Although the Emancipation Proclamation had formally freed them almost two and a half years earlier and the American Civil War had largely ended with the defeat of the Confederate States in April, Texas was the most remote of the slave states, with a low presence of Union troops, so enforcement of the proclamation had been slow and inconsistent.**** Wikipedia. #junteenth #freedomday",8,16.88832594,5,2,1

We are very grateful that Hasna used her talents to not only raise awareness about sex trafficking but to give a glimpse of the path that individuals victimized by sex trafficking often endure.  To learn more, follow Hasnaäó»s IG account. @hasnasalofficial

From offering contact information to making a phone call to help with transportation. Many non profits work together when helping people. There have been volunteers who take people to doctors appointments or sat with a survivor at the hospital. Thereäó»s been police officers who have delivered groceries or given a ride to a train station. Officers who have spent time talking to at risk youth or ones that comfort survivors by listening when no one else would. There are survivors who mentor those in need.

When more officers are trained to identify & investigate human trafficking crimes there will be fewer victims and more arrests of traffickers and buyers. 

What makes the business of human trafficking so lucrative?

Limitless Supply
Access to the Internet, Minimal social support, Poverty, Foster Care, History of Sexual Abuse, Low self-esteem, Mental Illness, Drug Addiction, Homelessness and Natural Disasters all contribute to the endless supply of victims. 

High Demand
Increasing demand for commercial sex - especially with young girls and boys - incentivizes commercial sex venues including strip clubs, pornography, and prostitution to recruit and exploit children. High demand drives the high volume of supply.

Huge Profit Margins
Studies show that sexual exploitation can yield a return on investment ranging from 100% to 1,000%, while an enslaved laborer can produce more than 50% profit even in less profitable markets.

Big Resale Value
In 2009, the average price of a slave was $90. A sex trafficking victim can be sold as many as 20-30 times a day. 

Low Risk
The number of Prosecutions of Human Traffickers is alarmingly low. Already burdened by increasing caseloads, prosecutors and law enforcement lack the training, time, and resources to investigate and prosecute human trafficking crimes.

The National Coalition Against Domestic Violence (NCADV) reports that 1 in 3 Women in the United States have experienced violence by their intimate partner at some point in their life. To make matters worse, 40% of those females affected are killed by their significant other.
However, women are not the only ones affected - 24% of victims of domestic violence are men.
In recent years, there has been a noted trend in couples getting married at a much later time in
their lives. Consequently, dating violence continues to escalate. Sadly, teenagers are not immune.
The NCADV reports that approximately 1.5 million youth in our schools are victims of dating
violence and maltreatment each year. Dr. Maria Cristina Regueiro, President and CEO of Florida

 ""FBI warns popular app for teens helps child predators go undetected

An app used to find friends has become popular among teenagers and has also caught the attention of the FBI.

The app, called Yellow, allows users to chat and share pictures.

After downloading the app, the user must enter a birth date.

The app wonäó»t allow anyone under the age of 13 to create a profile, but FBI agents said child predators are posing as teens to find victims.

Yellow is marketed as an app that can be used to make new friends who are close by.

The user swipes right if they are interested in the person, and left if theyäó»re uninterested. Itäó»s similar to the dating app Tinder and has been dubbed äóěTinder for teens.äóť
äóěThis app, as well as other apps, are definitely on our radar,äóť said FBI Agent Kevin Kaufman.""
