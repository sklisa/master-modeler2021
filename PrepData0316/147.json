We need your help! 3 survivors of human trafficking need our support in seeking justice. We know we have the best FB community out there who can help! \nOn April 7 two human traffickers will be sentenced for the heinous crimes they committed against the survivors. We need to fill the courtroom and show there is a community that stands with survivors and we will not tolerate people being treating as property. We need to let the Judge know that these men deserve the maximum sentence possible and we don\u2019t want them back on our streets. Court details below.\n\nPlease share, tag your friends, ask anyone you know in the area to join in supporting the survivors. If you cannot make it please leave a comment showing your support for the survivors. \n\nThis week is National Crime Victims' Rights Week. \u2018This year\u2019s theme\u2014Strength. Resilience. Justice.\u2014reflects a vision for the future in which all victims are strengthened by the response they receive, organizations are resilient in response to challenges, and communities are able to seek collective justice and healing.\u201d\n\nAs a community, it\u2019s time to come together and do our part. I\u2019m tagging people to ask them to share and rally their communities. \nThank you FB Family!\n\nThe sentencing is Friday, April 7th at 10:00am in courtroom 4-7 before Judge Richard Hersch.
