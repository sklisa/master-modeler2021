We don\u2019t share information or stories about our survivors for various reasons. Mostly because it\u2019s their story to tell not ours. We are to help how we can and we are not alone. Many people help in different ways. From offering contact information to making a phone call to help with transportation. Many non profits work together when helping people. There have been volunteers who take people to doctors appointments or sat with a survivor at the hospital. There\u2019s been police officers who have delivered groceries or given a ride to a train station. Officers who have spent time talking to at risk youth or ones that comfort survivors by listening when no one else would. There are survivors who mentor those in need. There is our HelpERASE community that shares and talks about human trafficking awareness. The list is endless! Many people help out never expecting a \u201cthank you\u201d in return. They do these things without recognition. We want to say \u201cThank You\u201d to all those people. We appreciate everything you do and couldn\u2019t do it without you!\n#togetherwecanmakeadifference", "cleaned_message": ["hero", "ordinari", "peopl", "extraordinari", "thing", "fight", "human", "traffick", "success", "without", "collabor", "share", "inform", "stori", "survivor", "variou", "reason", "mostli", "stori", "tell", "help", "alon", "mani", "peopl", "help", "differ", "way", "offer", "contact", "inform", "make", "phone", "call", "help", "transport", "mani", "non", "profit", "work", "togeth", "help", "peopl", "volunt", "take", "peopl", "doctor", "appoint", "sat", "survivor", "hospit", "polic", "offic", "deliv", "groceri", "given", "ride", "train", "station", "offic", "spent", "time", "talk", "risk", "youth", "one", "comfort", "survivor", "listen", "one", "els", "would", "survivor", "mentor", "need", "helperas", "commun", "share", "talk", "human", "traffick", "awar", "list", "endless", "mani", "peopl", "help", "never", "expect", "thank", "return", "thing", "without", "recognit", "want", "say", "thank", "peopl", "appreci", "everyth", "without"], "emojis": null, "mentions": null, "names": null, "message_tags": ["togetherwecanmakeadifference"], "attachments": [{"media_type": "photo", "media_url": "https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/29063437_1783333468384987_3927453481421504512_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=l8egq_jEx-MAX-azlbz&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.xx&tp=6&oh=06e51fa3bbf0fb3416db846b0b21431c&oe=6070C982", "media_description": null, "thumbnail_url": null}], "urls": null, "original_date": "09 Mar, 2018 15:07", "total_engagement": 6, "engagement_rate": 27.35978112, "reactions": 3, "shares": 2, "comments": 1, "date": "2018-03-09", "day_week": 4, "Mon": 0, "Tue": 0, "Wed": 0, "Thur": 0, "Fri": 1, "Sat": 0, "event": 0, "season": 1, "winter": 0, "spring": 1, "summer": 0, "hour": 15, "time_day": 2, "morning": 0, "afternoon": 1, "evening": 0, "emoji_num": 0, "mention_num": 0, "name_num": 0, "share": 0, "share_url": null, "photo": 1, "photo_url": "https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/29063437_1783333468384987_3927453481421504512_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=l8egq_jEx-MAX-azlbz&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.xx&tp=6&oh=06e51fa3bbf0fb3416db846b0b21431c&oe=6070C982", "video": 0, "video_url": null, "media_desc": null, "thumbnail_url": null, "link": 0, "face_present": 0, "engagement_rate_label": 0, "total_engagement_label": 0}
