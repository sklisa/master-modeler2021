Chances are it was both. What we do know is that people lost their lives because someone did not value the lives of all the people in the back of that truck. Greed/Money became more important than a person's life. That is a reoccurring theme in Human Trafficking. This is a problem that effects all communities all across the country. \n\nThe Walmart employee that provided the water and then called the police probably saved many lives. Sometimes the simplest act can make a difference. Together we can make a difference. Together we can be a voice to the voiceless. \n\n#GiveFreedom\n#HelpERASE\n\nhttps://usat.ly/2eFt68L", "cleaned_message": ["inform", "releas", "know", "human", "traffick", "human", "smuggl", "chanc", "know", "peopl", "lost", "live", "someon", "valu", "live", "peopl", "back", "truck", "greed", "money", "becam", "import", "person", "life", "reoccur", "theme", "human", "traffick", "problem", "effect", "commun", "across", "countri", "walmart", "employe", "provid", "water", "call", "polic", "probabl", "save", "mani", "live", "sometim", "simplest", "act", "make", "differ", "togeth", "make", "differ", "togeth", "voic", "voiceless"], "emojis": null, "mentions": null, "names": ["Greed Money"], "message_tags": ["GiveFreedom", "helpERASE"], "attachments": [{"media_type": "share", "media_url": "https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fusat.ly%2F2eFt68L&h=AT1OQzUAtYDbR8IPppI5MDVwWMITOBnHfqDVSagzX7Ismy2O7J9tP63KbXg-MmxEfBEhmKR_-MLjjBg5d4xzbRV-PlI-Is7mU7x0ZbvWs83KiII8y21BrEwZDA-93qMZ&s=1", "media_description": "8 found dead in packed, blistering hot truck in Texas Walmart parking lot", "thumbnail_url": "https://external-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQHTZT0eqI0D2hGA&w=720&h=720&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gannett-cdn.com%2F-mm-%2Fa4b3118c93b683222163cd4d9939c6c227914bbb%2Fc%3D0-265-2829-1864%26r%3Dx803%26c%3D1600x800%2Flocal%2F-%2Fmedia%2F2017%2F07%2F23%2FUSATODAY%2FUSATODAY%2F636363969733716863-EPA-USA-SAN-ANTONIO-8-PEOPLE-DEAD-TRACTOR-TRAILER-92573729.JPG&cfs=1&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQECt6a3GYr8dpI4"}], "urls": ["https://usat.ly/2eFt68L"], "original_date": "23 Jul, 2017 11:12", "total_engagement": 46, "engagement_rate": 247.71136239999998, "reactions": 24, "shares": 21, "comments": 1, "date": "2017-07-23", "day_week": 6, "Mon": 0, "Tue": 0, "Wed": 0, "Thur": 0, "Fri": 0, "Sat": 0, "event": 0, "season": 2, "winter": 0, "spring": 0, "summer": 1, "hour": 11, "time_day": 1, "morning": 1, "afternoon": 0, "evening": 0, "emoji_num": 0, "mention_num": 0, "name_num": 1, "share": 1, "share_url": "https://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=https%3A%2F%2Fusat.ly%2F2eFt68L&h=AT1OQzUAtYDbR8IPppI5MDVwWMITOBnHfqDVSagzX7Ismy2O7J9tP63KbXg-MmxEfBEhmKR_-MLjjBg5d4xzbRV-PlI-Is7mU7x0ZbvWs83KiII8y21BrEwZDA-93qMZ&s=1", "photo": 0, "photo_url": null, "video": 0, "video_url": null, "media_desc": "8 found dead in packed, blistering hot truck in Texas Walmart parking lot", "thumbnail_url": "https://external-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?d=AQHTZT0eqI0D2hGA&w=720&h=720&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gannett-cdn.com%2F-mm-%2Fa4b3118c93b683222163cd4d9939c6c227914bbb%2Fc%3D0-265-2829-1864%26r%3Dx803%26c%3D1600x800%2Flocal%2F-%2Fmedia%2F2017%2F07%2F23%2FUSATODAY%2FUSATODAY%2F636363969733716863-EPA-USA-SAN-ANTONIO-8-PEOPLE-DEAD-TRACTOR-TRAILER-92573729.JPG&cfs=1&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQECt6a3GYr8dpI4", "link": 1, "face_present": 0, "engagement_rate_label": 2, "total_engagement_label": 2}
