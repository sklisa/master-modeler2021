As he educated himself on the subject, he found the issue, in part, was rooted in early childhood domestic sexual abuse. \n\nThe thought that women sell their bodies because they are addicted to drugs is not the truth. Victims of early childhood sexual abuse experience trauma that makes them more susceptible to drugs and further victimization from men all around the world looking to make money off of them. \n\n1/3 of women in prostitution start before they are 15 years old. 66% start before their 18th birthday. For women who have entered CATCH Court, the average age for when they first faced sexual abuse is 8.5 years old. \n\n\u201cIf you have a child, make sure you know what they\u2019re doing on their cell phone. Cell phones are the number 1 tool used to lure kids into situations that lead to trafficking.\u201d\n\nToday is #HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay.", "cleaned_message": ["human", "traffick", "exclus", "big", "event", "happen", "day", "year", "judg", "paul", "herbert", "start", "catch", "chang", "action", "chang", "habit", "court", "columbu", "respons", "overwhelm", "number", "domest", "violenc", "prostitut", "case", "come", "court", "educ", "subject", "found", "issu", "part", "root", "earli", "childhood", "domest", "sexual", "abus", "thought", "women", "sell", "bodi", "addict", "drug", "truth", "victim", "earli", "childhood", "sexual", "abus", "experi", "trauma", "make", "suscept", "drug", "victim", "men", "around", "world", "look", "make", "money", "women", "prostitut", "start", "year", "old", "start", "th", "birthday", "women", "enter", "catch", "court", "averag", "age", "first", "face", "sexual", "abus", "year", "old", "child", "make", "sure", "know", "cell", "phone", "cell", "phone", "number", "tool", "use", "lure", "kid", "situat", "lead", "traffick", "today"], "emojis": null, "mentions": ["harmonycolumbus"], "names": ["Paul Herbert"], "message_tags": ["Repost", "HumanTraffickingAwarenessDay"], "attachments": [{"media_type": "photo", "media_url": "https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/136428939_3813610328690614_7789643099680376563_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=9e2e56&_nc_ohc=wjzCPbXDbuQAX8OUbDz&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.xx&tp=7&oh=d2554365d752989082c844aa36d61e5d&oe=606E920C", "media_description": null, "thumbnail_url": null}], "urls": null, "original_date": "11 Jan, 2021 19:38", "total_engagement": 14, "engagement_rate": 29.554570399999996, "reactions": 9, "shares": 5, "comments": 0, "date": "2021-01-12", "day_week": 1, "Mon": 0, "Tue": 1, "Wed": 0, "Thur": 0, "Fri": 0, "Sat": 0, "season": 0, "winter": 1, "spring": 0, "summer": 0, "hour": 19, "time_day": 3, "morning": 0, "afternoon": 0, "evening": 1, "emoji_num": 0, "mention_num": 1, "name_num": 1, "share": 0, "share_url": null, "photo": 1, "photo_url": "https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/s720x720/136428939_3813610328690614_7789643099680376563_o.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=9e2e56&_nc_ohc=wjzCPbXDbuQAX8OUbDz&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.xx&tp=7&oh=d2554365d752989082c844aa36d61e5d&oe=606E920C", "video": 0, "video_url": null, "media_desc": null, "thumbnail_url": null, "link": 0, "face_present": 1, "engagement_rate_label": 1, "total_engagement_label": 1, "engagement_rate_label2": 1, "total_engagement_label2": 1, "engagement_rate_label3": 0, "total_engagement_label3": 1, "weighted_engagement": 9.5, "recovered": 0, "missing": 0, "asterisk": 0, "federal": 0, "special_day": 1, "face_vague": 0, "hashtag_num": 2, "weighted_engagement_label": 2, "weighted_engagement_label2": 1, "weighted_engagement_label3": 1}
