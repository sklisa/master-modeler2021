We need more than 2 or 3 days or a month out of the year that people come together and discuss human trafficking. We need it to be an everyday conversation. That can happen in many ways. Talk with your children about the dangers of social media, ask your local police department to come to your schools and talk about human trafficking. Research non profits in your area and volunteer. \nThis is a heinous crime. As a community we need to protect the vulnerable that traffickers prey upon. Please keep the #Endit mindset 365 days a year not just today. \n#makeadifference", "cleaned_message": ["great", "see", "facebook", "instagram", "twitter", "feed", "today", "ask", "peopl", "take", "step", "need", "day", "month", "year", "peopl", "come", "togeth", "discuss", "human", "traffick", "need", "everyday", "convers", "happen", "mani", "way", "talk", "children", "danger", "social", "media", "ask", "local", "polic", "depart", "come", "school", "talk", "human", "traffick", "research", "non", "profit", "area", "volunt", "heinou", "crime", "commun", "need", "protect", "vulner", "traffick", "prey", "upon", "pleas", "keep", "mindset", "day", "year", "today"], "emojis": ["\u274c"], "mentions": null, "names": null, "message_tags": ["enditmovement", "endit", "makeadifference"], "attachments": null, "urls": null, "original_date": "22 Feb, 2018 16:17", "total_engagement": 13, "engagement_rate": 59.7976081, "reactions": 10, "shares": 3, "comments": 0, "date": "2018-02-22", "day_week": 3, "Mon": 0, "Tue": 0, "Wed": 0, "Thur": 1, "Fri": 0, "Sat": 0, "event": 0, "season": 0, "winter": 1, "spring": 0, "summer": 0, "hour": 16, "time_day": 2, "morning": 0, "afternoon": 1, "evening": 0, "emoji_num": 1, "mention_num": 0, "name_num": 0, "share": 0, "share_url": null, "photo": 0, "photo_url": null, "video": 0, "video_url": null, "media_desc": [], "thumbnail_url": [], "link": 0, "face_present": 0, "engagement_rate_label": 1, "total_engagement_label": 1}
