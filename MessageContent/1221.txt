 Sometime back I received in the name of our country the bodies of four Marines who had died while on active duty I said then that there is a special sadness that accompanies the death of a serviceman for we re never quite good enough to them not really we can t be because what they gave us is beyond our powers to repay And so when a serviceman dies it s a tear in the fabric a break in the whole and all we can do is remember President Ronald Reagan
