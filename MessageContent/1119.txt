This is a great perspective from Dr Kimberly Mehlman-Orozco on why passing FOSTA will not stop sex trafficking It may help in the short term but until the demand is stopped trafficking will continue This is why we support training law enforcement they can go after both the buyer and the seller and disrupt human trafficking No Demand No Supply
