 Did you know that around of all child sex trafficking victims have histories in the child welfare system We work with adults and almost half of the women we work with were in the foster care system and aged out Children without families to make them feel loved cared for and protected are particularly vulnerable to exploitation by traffickers This adorable coffee shop just opened up in Dallas TX and employees youth that have aged out of the foster care system Jobs are a huge barrier for the women we work with for many reasons This is a huge step in the right direction and we can t wait to see the positive impact this establishment will have in decreasing the trafficking stats for these individuals in our area Thank you for joining the fight in a unique way We appreciate you
