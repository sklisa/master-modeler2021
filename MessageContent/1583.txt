Recently we had the privilege of presenting our Human Trafficking Investigations Class to Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Police and their neighboring tribal local state and federal law enforcement partners It truly was an honor to train a group so dedicated to combatting human trafficking Tribal Police Chief Matthew Rourke and his department were an amazing host for the class Chief Rourke s support in implementing this training and his active participation throughout the entire training was inspirational We are grateful to everyone at Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe who helped in bringing this class to their community especially the folks at the Social Services Division We look forward to working with them again in the future
