January we held our first Law Enforcement Human Trafficking Training in south Florida at Aventura Police Department Over the past year in addition to FL we have held several classes in NC NJ CA and NY We have had over agencies from local state federal agencies and tribal police send participants Last month we marked our one year of classes in the Los Angeles area at Montebello Police Department and next month we are heading back to south Florida We have learned so much valuable information along the way and continue to make changes to the curriculum Our primary goal with this program has always been to assist law enforcement with the tools and techniques they need to detect and investigate human trafficking crimes We are grateful to Thorn and Callyo for sharing their great products during the class Over the past year we have had amazing instructors presenters and guest speakers Most of all we have made great connections and friends with law enforcement officers who are in the fight against human trafficking
