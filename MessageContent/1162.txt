We love seeing this It s going to take our communities and our neighbors to help end human trafficking Without community we are not nearly as effective When people take a stand against trafficking we are lending a voice to those who don t have one I ve been blessed to participate in many ways in the fight against slavery I didn t know what to do I didn t know how to do it However when I was asked I did something I ve had a part in changing lives Saving people from their captors and helping others into recovery When I m lying on my deathbed this will not be a regret
