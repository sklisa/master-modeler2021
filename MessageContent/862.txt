Last week we hosted our first Advanced Human Trafficking Investigations Training Course We had several amazing speakers take time out of their busy schedules to come and talk They offered insight and resources to the officers We are especially grateful to Kelley Alsobrook a survivor of human trafficking who shared her story with the class We have many people and law enforcement agencies to thank for helping to bring this training to South Florida and for sending their officers to the class Thank you
