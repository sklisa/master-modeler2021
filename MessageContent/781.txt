Human trafficking is slavery It is the exploitation of human beings for involuntary sex or labor In robbing its victims of their liberty and autonomy it is as morally repugnant as slavery in any other form It treats human beings as commodities to be bought and sold While its vileness places human trafficking on the level of slavery it presents a unique set of challenges It is a crime that remains hidden with victims trapped in a spiraling cycle of brutality abuse and repression unless and until someone helps to rescue them
