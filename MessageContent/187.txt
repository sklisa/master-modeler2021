One of our programs is providing law enforcement officers a -day course on Human Trafficking Investigations Through donations we provide the training at no cost to the officers Currently there are few in-depth courses that provide this training After each class we have seen where the education has made an impact Law enforcement officers are on the front lines of human trafficking and they need the training and the tools to combat this horrific problem If you or your company would like to donate to help sponsor a class please click on the link in our profile Together we can make a difference
