The bottom line is that if you re a U S government contractor it s not enough for you to rely on the word of your subcontractors or suppliers that they don t have modern slavery conditions You need to develop an auditing system whereby you can show that high-risk areas of your supply chain receive a routine check Failure to do so could result in loss of your U S government contract Even worse if you have attested that you do audit but you actually don t you may even open yourself up to civil or criminal liability
