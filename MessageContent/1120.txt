It s great seeing on Facebook Instagram and Twitter feeds today We are asking people to take it a step further We need more than or days or a month out of the year that people come together and discuss human trafficking We need it to be an everyday conversation That can happen in many ways Talk with your children about the dangers of social media ask your local police department to come to your schools and talk about human trafficking Research non profits in your area and volunteer This is a heinous crime As a community we need to protect the vulnerable that traffickers prey upon Please keep the mindset days a year not just today
