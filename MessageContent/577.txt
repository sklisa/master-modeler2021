Awareness is key Thank you Yesterday was people wore blue and posted about modern day slavery For several hours I read and researched and also talked to my good friend who is a foster mom and strong advocate for children Yesterday was my day for learning so I could post today Let s shine a light on this multi-billion dollar and the fastest growing criminal industry in the world - and increasing at an even faster pace because of our lockdown response to the pandemic I m not going to go into detail about what happens to these slaves but it s devastating and about a third of them are children And more than you d think is happening right here in the U S some hiding in plain sight It s not comfortable to think about but heck nothing in feels comfortable anyway so why not educate ourselves and be a positive force Once upon a time slavery was legal in this country So many citizens chose to ignore the devastation happening right in front of them Let s not be those people who chose to ignore slavery because it s uncomfortable Modern day slavery is real it s horrific and needs our attention and advocacy What can we do Awareness We can follow accounts like and more to become aware and familiar over time and to see the heroic work they are doing - leave them comments periodically share their posts with your followers they will truly appreciate your involvement Volunteer Foster kids without a positive force in their lives are far more likely to become victims of trafficking Becoming a child advocate for a foster child through CASA link in bio is an incredible gift as is mentoring a high-risk child through a program like or These are the most valuable and heroic acts you could take aside from actually becoming a foster parent Donate Of course all of these organizations are working hard and donations keep them going If you ve taken the time to read all of this THANK YOU from the bottom of my heart And thank you in advance for any of the above items you choose to do
