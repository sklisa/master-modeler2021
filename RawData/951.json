Upon officer\u2019s arrival, they discovered that a 92 year old man was trying to withdraw money from his account, however his California identification card was expired. Per the banks policy, because his identification card was expired, they were unable to fulfill his request. The gentleman was upset and the police were called.  \n\nOnce officers arrived, Officer Robert Josett decided to take the man to the DMV in town to help him renew his identification card. With the assistance of the DMV, his identification card was renewed and he was taken back to the bank at which time he was able to withdraw money from his account. He thanked Officer Josett and went on his way.", "media": {"image": {"height": 720, "src": "https://scontent-lax3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t31.0-8/s720x720/21762851_1677590065586376_5997939273364605640_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=2d5d41&_nc_ohc=YqimsIDySvIAX9HyqAc&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.xx&tp=7&oh=31a01e2088e64cf05518a8d159a8afde&oe=60722A9A", "width": 576}}, "target": {"id": "1677590065586376", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/montebellopd/photos/a.890812727597451/1677590065586376/?type=3"}, "title": "Timeline Photos", "type": "photo", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/montebellopd/photos/a.890812727597451/1677590065586376/?type=3"}]}, "id": "1003344626383879_1612198885498447"}
