The art installation, \u201cInto the Light\u201d, located at Lykins Square Park was created by glass artist and sculptor, Hasna Sal.\n\nWhile traveling, one of ERASE\u2019s team members had the opportunity to meet the artist and view the memorial. \n\nNot only is the memorial beautifully done but it also creates an awareness about sex trafficking for the people visiting the park. We need to see more of these around the country. \n\nWe are very grateful that Hasna used her talents to not only raise awareness about sex trafficking but to give a glimpse of the path that individuals victimized by sex trafficking often endure.
