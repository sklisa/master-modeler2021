Every day, she chooses to build her life the way she wants to.  She worries that she might end up turning back to the life she was rescued from, but now she knows that every day she can CHOOSE how she lives.  Izzy is learning every day how to make positive choices and seeing how those choices make a positive impact on her life.\n\nWhen a girl arrives at StreetLightUSA, she is presented with a Care Basket and introduced to our Choices Program. The Choices Program engages our residents and provides incentives for positive attitudes, decisions, participation and behaviors. StreetLightUSA is committed to the success that is generated by coupling these experiences with research based, trauma informed therapy.\n\nYour gift can help inspire a child to make good choices and reap the benefits with a triumphant future. \n\nSee your gift in action: slusataxcredit.org/12days\nDonate today: slusataxcredit.org/12daysdonate", "media": {"image": {"height": 720, "src": "https://scontent-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/p720x720/20106268_10155088979332670_4999957157694346558_n.jpg?_nc_cat=105&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=A5gxFkYZtDEAX_7a7Lp&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-1.xx&tp=6&oh=6d255c07d1bb6ea40db9ab99f7e29a11&oe=607184C0", "width": 720}}, "target": {"id": "10155088979332670", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/StreetLightUSA/photos/a.313136067669/10155088979332670/?type=3"}, "type": "photo", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/StreetLightUSA/photos/a.313136067669/10155088979332670/?type=3"}]}, "id": "1003344626383879_1550943988290604"}
