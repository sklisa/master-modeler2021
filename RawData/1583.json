It truly was an honor to train a group so dedicated to combatting human trafficking. \n\nTribal Police Chief Matthew Rourke and his department were an amazing host for the class. Chief Rourke\u2019s support in implementing this training and his active participation throughout the entire training was inspirational. We are grateful to everyone at Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe who helped in bringing this class to their community, especially the folks at the Social Services Division. We look forward to working with them again in the future. \n#LEO #MakingaDifference", "message_tags": [{"id": "479647825436380", "name": "#Leo", "offset": 738, "length": 4}, {"id": "136254236549866", "name": "#makingadifference", "offset": 743, "length": 18}], "place": {"name": "Saint Regis Mohawk Tribe", "location": {"city": "Hogansburg", "country": "United States", "latitude": 44.9870932, "longitude": -74.6758367, "state": "NY", "street": "71 Margaret Terrance Memorial Way", "zip": "13655"}, "id": "167325326636994"}, "permalink_url": "https://www.facebook.com/1003344626383879/posts/1701291136589221/", "attachments": {"data": [{"description": "Recently, we had the privilege of presenting our Human Trafficking Investigations Class to Saint Regis Mohawk Tribal Police and their neighboring tribal, local, state, and federal law enforcement partners.
