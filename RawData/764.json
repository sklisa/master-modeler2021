Last year, he was recognized for his quick actions, compassion and professionalism that prevented a juvenile from ending her own life. \n\nEveryday, there are officers just like him who help prevent those wanting to end their lives from doing so. Suicide is the third leading cause of death for youth between the ages of 10 and 24, and results in approximately 4,600 lives lost each year. \n\nIn honor of #SuicidePreventionWeek and #NationalSuicidePreventionMonth, reach out for help if you\u2019re depressed and need someone to talk to. It\u2019s ok not to be ok. \n\nIf you\u2019re noticing signs of depression in a friend or loved one, reach out to them. Have those difficult conversations. The more we talk about it the more we end the stigma surrounding suicide. \n\nNational Suicide Prevention Lifeline '1-800-273-TALK (8255)' 24/7. Free.
