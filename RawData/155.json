For both the Victim and Law Enforcement this is just the beginning of a long road ahead. Hopefully the victim will be connected with services in her area so she cant start a very difficult healing process. \nFor law enforcement they will start building a strong case to make sure no one else is victimized by this trafficker. \nThis is why we do the work we do at ERASE. We want to provide law enforcement the tools they need to recover victims. And want to help survivors reclaim their life. \n\n\"Girl found at a Gulfport hotel.
