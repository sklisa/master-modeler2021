My name is Alicia Bush, and I am the Founder and CEO of Treasured Vessels Foundation. I am a wife and homeschooling mom of 3. I founded TVF in 2016 when I learned about the lack of placement for children being recovered from domestic sex trafficking in North Texas. I felt a strong calling to do something about the epidemic of sex trafficking that is running rampant in my backyard (Dallas). Treasured Vessels Foundation is going to build a safe and peaceful place for these girls to call home. Our goal is to place the tools in their hands needed to decrease their vulnerability and empower them. We want to help restore hope for the future and purpose to their calling. You are helping rewrite the stories of children in North Texas affected by domestic sex trafficking by providing a safe and peaceful place they can call home. Thank you for partnering with us monetarily and sharing the message with your communities! Together, we can make a change!", "media": {"image": {"height": 720, "src": "https://scontent-lax3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-0/p480x480/39986177_1568899099882412_635023799615488_o.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=8024bb&_nc_ohc=uf_02Z_F-74AX_Rl5Rh&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.xx&tp=6&oh=2f70d52942de8ba79f63e40aca164f4e&oe=606F4F26", "width": 480}}, "target": {"id": "1568899096549079", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/treasuredvesselsfoundation.org/photos/a.756009187838078/1568899096549079/?type=3"}, "type": "photo", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/treasuredvesselsfoundation.org/photos/a.756009187838078/1568899096549079/?type=3"}]}, "id": "1003344626383879_1995716463813352"}
