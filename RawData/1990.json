Children shouldn\u2019t be given the burden of having to make an outcry for help before someone steps in with assistance. Their safety is OUR responsibility as a community. Please follow Guiding Light Outreach for more great information.", "permalink_url": "https://www.facebook.com/1003344626383879/posts/2805603156158008/", "attachments": {"data": [{"description": "Looking back, as a child victim of human trafficking I was not a high school dropout, I was disenrolled because of my poor attendance. No one asked why. My sixteenth birthday was on a  Monday, they disenrolled me on a Friday. I walked away feeling broken. No where to go. More days alone to be sexual abused for food and shelter.  \nHow could a child in all honour classes fall through the cracks?  How could this happen to any child from a community, any child in a school system, ANY CHILD!\n\nDisenrolled: to remove from a roll broadly: to release from membership in an organization.\n\n* I lost my membership to Miami-Dade County Public System. (It's still happening to children today.)\n\nDropout: a person who had abandoned a course of study or who has rejected conventional society to pursue an alternative lifestyle. \n\n(I didn't choose what happened to me.)\n\nIf I say I was a high school dropout that places the responsibility on me.\n\nGuiding Light Outreach Inc. purpose is to shine light on community issues.  We can see \"red flags\" before or while a child is being victimized and  before they become a \"criminal.\" Poor school attendance, declining school performance, isolation, change in pattern, change in interest. \n\nAwareness Tips: School attendance and grades can tell alot about a child's home/living situation. Teachers can better teach a mentally and physically healthy child. \n\nSchool faculty and staff you are on the frontlines. \n\nDrugs, gang activity, sexual abuse, verbal abuse, homelessness, depression, learning disabilities, etc. are all issues that a school system can help identify then we must have the resources. We are here to help. \n\nInbox or call us if you are not clear on how you can help a child.", "media": {"image": {"height": 466, "src": "https://scontent-lax3-2.xx.fbcdn.net/v/t1.0-9/80025285_2427883610650400_7353688076150898688_n.jpg?_nc_cat=111&ccb=1-3&_nc_sid=110474&_nc_ohc=XxA5p0TShPQAX_2owV0&_nc_ht=scontent-lax3-2.xx&oh=a292d8170713b1c480b252297e7fd2d5&oe=606EC589", "width": 466}}, "target": {"id": "2427883607317067", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/gloinc.2012/photos/a.1396083463830425/2427883607317067/?type=3"}, "type": "photo", "url": "https://www.facebook.com/gloinc.2012/photos/a.1396083463830425/2427883607317067/?type=3"}]}, "id": "1003344626383879_2805603156158008"}
