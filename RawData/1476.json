You need to develop an auditing system whereby you can show that high-risk areas of your supply chain receive a routine check.  Failure to do so could result in loss of your U.S. government contract. Even worse, if you have attested that you do audit, but you actually don\u2019t, you may even open yourself up to civil or criminal liability.", "permalink_url": "https://www.facebook.com/1003344626383879/posts/1773138789404455/", "attachments": {"data": [{"description": "Subcontractors or suppliers could have modern slavery conditions.", "media": {"image": {"height": 720, "src": "https://external-lax3-1.xx.fbcdn.net/safe_image.php?w=720&h=720&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.ehstoday.com%2Fsites%2Fehstoday.com%2Ffiles%2Fhumantrafficking.jpg&cfs=1&_nc_cb=1&_nc_hash=AQEQZvmdeYYtYleY", "width": 720}}, "target": {"url": "http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fj.mp%2F2EYWCPm&h=AT00Xan2dd-2mTcvYJ51IKjVTDK683cjeIkEwsdGttTyPVHP5o29fquF69mie33ymfSEqsSk8Xfyc9bMiuv-VUBcCIzsPT5JRwAt2hyAF4SC_uVph0qcu2vPCpay9nBK&s=1"}, "title": "How Human Trafficking Laws Can Shut You Down", "type": "share", "url": "http://l.facebook.com/l.php?u=http%3A%2F%2Fj.mp%2F2EYWCPm&h=AT00Xan2dd-2mTcvYJ51IKjVTDK683cjeIkEwsdGttTyPVHP5o29fquF69mie33ymfSEqsSk8Xfyc9bMiuv-VUBcCIzsPT5JRwAt2hyAF4SC_uVph0qcu2vPCpay9nBK&s=1"}]}, "id": "1003344626383879_1773138789404455"}
