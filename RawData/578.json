We want them to know they are SEEN, we want them to feel CARED for and we want to help them HEAL. \nThis year I am doing a fundraiser for ERASE Child Trafficking - a US based non-profit dedicated to educating communities, recovering victims and providing aftercare to survivors. Their vast reach and intense involvement in this field is unmatched. The ERASE team can be found nationwide training law enforement, speaking at public events, acquiring housing & transporation for survivors as well as many other behind-the-scene duties.\nBeing a part of ERASE, I've seen first hand how far even the smallest of donations can go. A donation of $5 may buy lunch for a survivor on her first day of freedom. A donation of $10 may get him basic toiletries for his new life. A donation of $50 may get him a bus pass or basic cell phone. A donation of $100 may help her acquire a new wardrobe. A donation of $425 pays for the full training of a law enforcement individual learning the lastest tips, technology and mindsets in the fight against Human Trafficking.\n\nThis year I'm asking for help getting victims, survivors & conquerors \nSEEN, CARED FOR & HEALED. \nI'm asking YOU to be a Band-Aid.\nMy goal is to find 100 donors willing to kick in $5 (the lowest amount FB is willing to process) in an effort to show our community cares. Will you buy a $5 Band-Aid?\n#hiddenpain #unseen #trauma #support #LE #MakingADifference #pimplife to #lifeinjail", "message_tags": [{"id": "136439536532701", "name": "#hiddenpain", "offset": 2013, "length": 11}, {"id": "104297339759624", "name": "#unseen", "offset": 2025, "length": 7}, {"id": "127803354068000", "name": "#Trauma", "offset": 2033, "length": 7}, {"id": "437091936369906", "name": "#support", "offset": 2041, "length": 8}, {"id": "171980396286315", "name": "#le", "offset": 2050, "length": 3}, {"id": "136254236549866", "name": "#makingadifference", "offset": 2054, "length": 18}, {"id": "435112863233357", "name": "#pimplife", "offset": 2073, "length": 9}, {"id": "563968370314913", "name": "#lifeinjail", "offset": 2086, "length": 11}], "permalink_url": "https://www.facebook.com/helperase/photos/a.1029649477086727/2705072212877770/?type=3", "attachments": {"data": [{"description": "Karena is getting ready for the morning.
